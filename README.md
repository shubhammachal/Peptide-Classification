# Peptide-Classification
Developed and trained a predictive neural networks that can determine, given an antibacterial peptide, whether it is also an antibiofilm peptide.
## Description
Biofilms are tightly-connected multicellular communities of microorganisms encased in self secreted extra-cellular matrices. They are currently one of the major causes of disease for two main reasons. First, roughly 75% of all human infections are caused by biofilms. Second, due to the robust multicellular cellular matrix structure, they are resistant both to
the host defense mechanisms and to traditional antimicrobial compounds (antibiotics).
Thus, it is important to identify peptide sequences that are not only antimicrobial, but also antibiofilm.
This repository contains all the code and datasets.
